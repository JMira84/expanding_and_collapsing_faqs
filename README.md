# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file and/or the source HTML and CSS files. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's README.md file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
